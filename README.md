# Journal-I-v2

Use this program to write text with attached dates i.e. devlog or diary

To use the program download the Release in bin folder

The program is set to UK dates but feel free to change it in the code

The entry manager is a standard WPF Data Grid so to enact changes press or enter (or if deleting a row just press the "del" key)
